\chapter{Projections}
\section{Introduction}
Why we need to worry about projections? I'm going to let you in on a geographic secret ``the world is round'' -- sadly most of the maps we draw are \textbf{flat}. This leaves us with a problem, as anyone who has ever tried to gift wrap a globe knows, it's hard to make a curved surface and a flat sheet match up. 

As the ever helpful XKCD points out in \cref{xkcd-projections} there are a lot of projections.

Before you go too deep into the world of projections you should download and (at least) skim \cite{snyder}. This will give you access to all the helpful maths that \GeoTools encodes for you (or if you are unlucky that you will need to add a new projection to the library).
